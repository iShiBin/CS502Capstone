# Team 3 Capstone: Real-Time Movie Rating Data Pipeline

Introduction
------------

This data pipline will process the Netflix movie real-time rating data, visualize the movie rating trend, and provide a scalable distributed database for real-time query, with a datawarehouse for batching processing.

	Netflix Prize data

Architecture
------------

	data-ingestion-sinking-layer: Kafka, Kafka Connect
	data-transformation-layer: Kafka Streaming
	data-storage-layer: AWS S3, Cassandra
	data-visualization-layer: NodeJS

Detailed Schema
---------------

	Cassandra tables:

	CREATE TABLE movie_rating_cs502 (
			start_time timestamp,
			rating float,
			movie_id int,
			count int,
			movie_title text,
			PRIMARY KEY (start_time, rating, movie_id)
	) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (rating DESC, movie_id ASC)
	
	CREATE TABLE bittiger.movie_cs502 (
			movie_id int,
			start_time timestamp,
			count int,
			movie_title text,
			rating float,
			PRIMARY KEY (movie_id, start_time)
	) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (start_time DESC)

Deliverable
---------------

	Outcome: 
	
		(1)We are going to have a scalable distributed data pipeline for real-time data processing and sinking;
		(2)We are going to provide a scalable distributed database for real-time query like:
			a: Top 10 highest rating movie by a given month
			b: Top 10 rated movie by a given month
			c: Top rated month by a movie
		(3)We are going to build a batch processing layer based on AWS S3 and Spark to forecast moive rating.
	
	Weekly milestone:
	
		Week1: Figure out project architecture, data source, determine the requirements and the functionalities to implement
		Week2: Each team member starts implementing their own module
		Week3: Each team member finishes their own module
		Week4: Testing, report documenting		
	
	Detail Ownerships:
	
		Tongzhou Zhou: Architecture design, implementation
		Week 1: Set up Kafka Cluster, Cassandra Cluster in AWS (Done)
		Week 2: Starts implement data transformation layer, Set up Kafka Connect to load data from Kafka Cluster to Cassandra Cluster (Done)
		Week 3: Finish implementing data transformation layer: (30% Done)
			(1) Aggregate the data into formats to support the Cassandra data schemas in (2)
			(2) Configure Cassandra data schema to support:
				a: Top 10 highest rating movie by a given month
				b: Top 10 rated movie by a given month
				c: Top rated month by a movie
			Finish S3 set up for batch data sinking.
		Week 4: Starts and finishes unit testing.
		
		Bin Shi: Data ingestion using kafka; Use machine learning to predict the movie rating
		Week 1: Produce data to kafka [done]
				Send movie title data [done]
				Send rating datea simulating the streaming [done]
		Week 2: Add error/exception handling and more comments in the source code [done]
		Week 3: Study the classification algorithm,and apply to Netflix dataset
		Week 4: Adjust the ML model & Summarize this project
		
		Albert: Data visualization 
		Week 1: Build database to store data.
		Week 2: design analyst algorithm, optimize database if needed.
		Week 3: Collaborate with Anthony to implement the backend for data visualization, and the front end to display data.
		Week 4: Starts and finishes unit testing.
		
		Anthony: Data visualization
